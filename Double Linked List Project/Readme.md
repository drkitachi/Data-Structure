# Homework 2: Doubly linked list, iterators

You are given llist.h, which is an implementation of a singly linked list with a nested iterator class. dllist.h is a copy of llist.h with TODO indicating which methods you will need to modify to convert it to a doubly linked list with a sentinel node. Implement those changes.

You will also need to modify main.cpp to fill in selectionSort, which takes two iterators. You can copy the code we wrote in class and make the appropriate changes so it works with iterators instead of array access.

As always, start by accepting the assignment in github classroom and activating travis.

Then clone it to your computer, create a hw branch, and start making changes.

Remember that you have not submitted until you have opened a pull request and @mentioned me.
